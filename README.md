# StoryBook EXAMPLE
# Description

This is an example repository where a UI-KIT was created using the storyBook library, it is a fairly simple example which draws from some work/projects in which I have participated.

* Some of the features that it integrates:
  * Compatible with react-native-vector-icons to include custom fonts or iconography in font format
  * Compatible with react-native-svg to include custom svg images
  * Compatible with styled Component so that the css to jsx transition is much more accessible
  * Compatible with lottie-react-native to include animations.
  * React-native-elements is used as a base for much faster and more agile development.
  * It starts with a defined color system
  * Responsive design
  * Latest version of React Native
  * Basic unit tests.
  
  
  
# How to test it?

 Clone repo `git@github.com:offcarlospetit/testStoryBook.git`
 
 then run `npm install`
 
 then run `npx react-native run-ios`
 
 
## NOTICE 
This StoryBook is only developed for iOS due to time issues, but due to the responsive system you get the same look and feel on both operating systems Android and iOS.
